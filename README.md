# About

A repository abstraction library based on the following abstractions:

# Usage

Say we have a `Person` object:

```scala
case class Person(firstname: String, lastname: String) extends Identifiable
```

A repository implementation would look like this:

```scala
class PersonRepository extends CrudOperations[Person] {

  override def create(resource: Person): Try[Person] = ???

  override def read(resourceId: String): Try[Option[Person]] = ???

  override def update(resource: Person): Try[Option[Person]] = ??? // this handles whole updates
  
  override def update(resourceId: String, updatePayload: String): Try[Option[AnyRef]] // this handles partial updates

  override def delete(resourceId: String): Try[Option[Unit]] = ???

}
```

There is also an asynchronous version of the above, it's merely a matter of extending `AsyncCrudOperations[Person]` instead.

# What's next?

- [x] rename this project to `kyriakos-lib-crud`
- [x] consider using HTTP PATCH in addition to PUT as per [RFC 5789](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789)
- [ ] http patch is implemented, implement put
